# Hi there 👋

Hi, I'm [AbdElrahman Elsayed](https://www.linkedin.com/in/geekabdo/), a passionate self-taught Cross Platform developer and a freelance software engineer from Egypt. My passion for software lies with dreaming up ideas and making them come true with elegant interfaces. I take great care in the experience, architecture, and code quality of the things I build.
I am also an open-source enthusiast and maintainer. I learned a lot from the open-source community and I love how collaboration and knowledge sharing happened through open-source.
